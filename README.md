# WidgetKit

WidgetKit gives users ready access to content in apps by putting widgets on the iOS Home screen or macOS Notification Center. Widgets now come in multiple sizes, and users can visit the new widget gallery to search, preview sizes, and place them anywhere on the Home screen to access important details at a glance.
